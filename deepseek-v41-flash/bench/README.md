# bench/

`bench.py` measures one running server (`../start.sh`) and writes a JSON row.
It reports the two numbers the SGLang cookbook reports — TTFT and TPOT — plus
decode tok/s, so a row here is directly comparable to a row from the
[ling3-flash-spark](https://github.com/0xBakeer/ling3-flash-spark) harness that
this one is adapted from.

It also records what the ling3 harness has no equivalent of: **the engine's own
`x_engine_stats`**. On this recipe the model is not resident — the routed
experts are 288.8 GB against an arena of tens of GB — so a tok/s number without
the expert hit rate and the GB read to produce it is not a result, it is an
anecdote.

```bash
python3 bench/bench.py --workload prose  --runs 3 --out results/prose.json
python3 bench/bench.py --workload code   --runs 3 --out results/code.json
python3 bench/bench.py --workload random --isl 8192 --osl 1024 --runs 3 --out results/random8k.json
python3 bench/bench.py --workload angry-birds --label hot --out results/angry-birds.json
python3 bench/bench.py --workload mario       --label hot --out results/mario.json
python3 bench/bench.py --workload prose --thinking --effort 90 --label think90
```

The base URL defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:$PORT` (`PORT` from your `.env`, else
8000) and can be overridden with `--base` or `$BENCH_BASE`, so a bench can never
silently measure a closed port while the server runs somewhere else.

## Workloads

| workload | prompt | default osl | what it is for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `prose` | ~50-token essay request | 1024 | the everyday number; least favourable to a drafter |
| `code`  | ~50-token "write an LRU cache" request | 1024 | the workload speculative decoding is best at |
| `random` | `--isl` unique random words (default 8192) | 1024 | the SGLang cookbook cell's workload; long-prefill behaviour |
| `angry-birds` | `tools/make_corpus.py::ONE_SHOTS[0]`, verbatim | 16384 | a real long generation, and a playable artefact |
| `mario` | `tools/make_corpus.py::ONE_SHOTS[1]`, verbatim | 16384 | same |

The two one-shot prompts are **byte-identical** to the ones in the routing-trace
corpus (`corpus/trace_corpus.jsonl`, built by `tools/make_corpus.py`). That is
the point of them: the expert hit rate they produce at serving time can be put
next to the coverage numbers `results/trace-*/stats/coverage.json` predicts for
the same text. Reword the prompt and that comparison is gone.

One-shot runs default to `--runs 1 --warmup 0` (they are minutes each) and write
the generated file to `results/oneshots/<label>-<workload>.html` — the fenced
HTML block is unwrapped, so the games open in a browser. `.txt` is written
instead when the model produced no HTML, which is itself the result. A second
measured run appends `-run2`. `--no-save-oneshot` turns the writing off.

## Definitions

- **TTFT** — wall time from request send to the first `content` or
  `reasoning_content` delta.
- **TPOT** — `(total − TTFT) / (completion_tokens − 1)`.
- **decode tok/s** — `(completion_tokens − 1) / (total − TTFT)`. Medians over
  the measured runs; every run's raw numbers stay in the JSON.
- **engine_median** — medians of `accept_len_mean`, `expert_hit_rate`,
  `nvme_gb` and `engram_rows` from the server's `x_engine_stats`. The full
  object (prefill/decode seconds, attention vs MoE split, prefill misses, NVMe
  read seconds) is kept per run under `raw[].x_engine_stats`.

## What the harness refuses to get wrong

1. **Token counts come from `usage.completion_tokens`, never from chunk
   counts.** Speculative decoding emits several accepted tokens per SSE chunk;
   counting chunks under-reports decode speed by 3–5×. `stream_options.include_usage`
   is on for every request and a run without usage raises, it does not guess.
2. **Every non-one-shot run gets a fresh prompt, and its length is verified.**
   Repeated filler tokenises at ~6.8 chars/token instead of ~4 (a prompt half
   the intended length). `random` prompts are unique numbered words fitted by
   ratio iteration until the *server's own tokenizer* reports the target length;
   a bounded bisect saturates and silently returns a 2× prompt.
3. **Prompt lengths are measured with `/v1/debug/prompt`, not a 1-token
   completion.** That endpoint renders the chat template and tokenises without
   touching the engine. The ling3 harness used a real completion for this;
   here a prefill is minutes of NVMe streaming, so the fitting loop would cost
   more than the benchmark it is setting up.
4. **Seeds include the label.** Two rows taken back-to-back on one server must
   not share prompts — on this engine a repeat is served not just from any
   prefix cache but from an expert arena the first run already warmed, which is
   the single easiest way to publish a hit rate that no cold client will see.
5. **Thinking is set with `chat_template_kwargs.thinking`.** That is the first
   branch of the server's precedence chain (`server/README.md`), so it is
   unambiguous; `--effort` rides along as `reasoning_effort`, which sets the
   budget without flipping thinking back on by itself.

6. **`--ignore-eos` when the number will be compared.** It sends the server's
   `ignore_eos` body field, which empties the stop-id set on both sides, so the
   completion is exactly `--osl` tokens and every row reports
   `finish_reason: length`. Without it a `prose` or `code` row stops wherever the
   model decided to, and two configs are then compared on two different amounts of
   work (and on different amounts of expert streaming). Leave it off for the
   one-shot game workloads, where a truncated HTML file is not a result.

## Reading a row honestly

Speculative decoding is lossless — the target verifies every drafted token — so
these workloads measure speed only, never quality. And the first bench after a
`./start.sh` is a *cold* number in a way the ling3 recipe never had: the arena
is warm-started from the trace ranking, but everything outside the hot set is
still an 18.8 MB NVMe read on first touch. `nvme_gb` in the first run versus the
third is the size of that effect, and it is the number this whole recipe lives
or dies by.
