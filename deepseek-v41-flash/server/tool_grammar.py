"""Grammar-constrained DSML tool calls.

The checkpoint tells the model, in its own system prompt (``TOOLS_TEMPLATE`` in
``encoding/encoding.py``), to emit tool calls as a DSML block::

    <｜DSML｜ calls>
    <｜DSML｜ invoke name="$TOOL">
    <｜DSML｜ parameter name="$P" string="true|false">$VALUE</｜DSML｜ parameter>
    </｜DSML｜ invoke>
    </｜DSML｜ calls>

and its own parser (``parse_tool_calls``) is strict about every byte of that:
``name="x" string="true">value<`` exactly, no duplicate parameter names, and
nothing at all after the closing tag of the block. With ~20 tool schemas in the
prompt the model drifts out of that format -- the value ends up inside the
``string`` attribute, or prose continues after the block -- and a drifting model
does not stop: it re-emits near-identical calls until the output cap.

This module removes the possibility. For the tool list of one request it builds
an EBNF grammar that describes exactly the legal calls block for *those* tools,
compiles it with xgrammar, and hands the engine a gate object that masks the
sampling distribution while (and only while) the model is inside the block.

Three things make the grammar small and unambiguous:

* Every DSML token contains U+FF5C (the fullwidth vertical bar). A parameter
  value is therefore "any run of characters that does not contain U+FF5C":
  HTML, code, JSON and prose stay legal inside a value, while the closing tag
  can never be confused with value text.
* Parameters are emitted in schema order, required ones mandatory and optional
  ones wrapped in ``?``. That makes "all required present" and "no duplicates"
  structural rather than a post-hoc check; the only freedom lost is the order,
  which the parser ignores anyway.
* The block is closed by construction, and the grammar ends there. Once the
  closing tag is emitted the matcher is complete, and a complete xgrammar
  matcher allows exactly one thing: the end-of-turn token. That is what stops
  the spiral.

There is one boundary the grammar alone cannot settle, and three rules here that
do. ``</`` is a single token, it is legal value text (an HTML close tag), and it
is also the first token of ``</｜DSML｜ parameter>``; once it has been emitted
the DSML bar is a legal continuation, and a model whose router is under pressure
sometimes takes it -- closing the parameter in the middle of the file it was
writing, or, with no tool call in sight at all, leaving a stray tag in ordinary
prose. So, on top of the grammar:

1. **Inside a parameter value**: after a ``</``, the bar is masked while the
   value looks like unbalanced markup (see :func:`markup_unbalanced`) and the
   character before the ``</`` is not a newline. Text that has genuinely
   finished a file ends the last line and closes on the next one, so the rule
   cannot trap a legitimate close; ``…Hamburg</`` with an open ``<title>`` is an
   HTML close tag and nothing else.
2. **Outside the block, with tools in the request**: the bar may only follow the
   ``<`` that opens the calls block, and is masked after anything else.
3. **With no tools at all** (:class:`PlainTextGate`): the bar has no legal use
   in the completion, and is masked everywhere.

Nothing here is engine-specific: the engine sees an object with ``observe`` and
``mask_rows`` (see ``server/engine_api.py``), and a request with no tools gets
the plain-text gate of rule 3.
