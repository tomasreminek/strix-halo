"""Engine interface for the OpenAI-compatible server.

The server talks to an inference engine through the small abstract class below.
The real DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash engine lives in ``engine/v41_engine.py`` (repo
root) and is imported lazily by ``app.py --engine v41``; ``MockEngine`` is a
tokenizer-only stand-in so the HTTP layer can be exercised without a GPU.

Contract (see ``Engine``):

* ``generate`` is a generator that yields *bursts* of newly generated token ids.
  Speculative decoding (DSpark) typically produces several tokens per step, so
  a burst is ``list[int]`` of length >= 1. The engine should stop after it has
  emitted a token in ``stop_token_ids`` (the stop token itself may be included
  in the last burst; the server truncates at the first stop id it sees) and it
  must stop after ``max_tokens`` tokens at the latest. After an EOS/stop id or
  ``max_tokens`` the server drains the generator (up to 4 more bursts, ignored)
  so an engine whose loop ends there gets to run its epilogue (stats). On a
  stop *string* or a client disconnect the server closes the generator
  instead -- ``GeneratorExit`` is raised at the pending ``yield`` -- so
  cache/arena cleanup belongs in a ``try/finally`` around the decode loop and
  the engine must be ready for the next request afterwards.
* Optional ``grammar`` keyword: a decoding gate, passed to any engine whose
  ``supports_grammar`` is true. A request that carries tools gets the tool-call
  grammar; one that does not gets the plain-text gate, which only keeps the DSML
  bar out of a completion that has no legal use for it. The engine owes the gate
  two calls, and nothing else:

      ``gate.observe(ids)``      every token the loop has settled on, in order,
                                 once (a burst at a time is fine).
      ``gate.mask_rows(logits, block_ids)``
                                 mask ``logits`` in place before anything reads
                                 it. ``logits`` is [R, V] (R = 1 for a plain
                                 step, or the verify block's rows) and
                                 ``block_ids`` the R token ids those rows follow
                                 -- ``[tok, draft0, ...]`` -- so that row i can
                                 be masked for the state after block[0..i]. Pass
                                 ``block_ids=None`` when there is only one row.
                                 The call leaves the gate's own state untouched,
                                 so speculation that is rolled back needs no
                                 undo; rows past the first illegal draft are
                                 left alone, which is safe because that draft is
                                 masked out of its own row and is therefore
                                 rejected there.

  The tool-call gate masks nothing until the model opens a tool-calls block
  (beyond one token that has no legal use outside it), and the plain-text gate
  masks that one token, so an engine may call both unconditionally.
  ``server/tool_grammar.py`` implements them.
* Optional ``context_margin`` (int, default 8 as read by the server): tokens
  the engine needs beyond ``len(prompt_ids) + max_tokens`` (DSpark draft
  block); the server clamps ``max_tokens`` so that
  ``prompt + max_tokens + margin <= max_context``.
* The server serialises calls: at most one ``generate`` runs at any time.
* ``stats`` returns whatever the engine wants to expose about the last
  generation (tok/s, draft acceptance rate, expert cache hit rate ...). It is
  passed through verbatim as ``x_engine_stats`` in responses.
