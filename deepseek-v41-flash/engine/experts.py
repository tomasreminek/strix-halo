"""
experts.py -- the routed-expert store for one-box serving.

15,360 routed experts x 18.8 MB (FP4 + UE8M0 scales) = 288.8 GB do not fit next to everything
else, so the experts live in three places:

  * the ARENA: a fixed number of GPU slots holding packed FP4 experts exactly as stored in the
    checkpoint (no re-quantization). Sized at start-up from the memory that is left.
  * the LRU: a map (layer, expert) -> slot, least-recently-used eviction, warm-started from a
    routing trace so the hottest experts are resident before the first request.
  * NVMe: every expert is read straight out of its layer's safetensors shard with O_DIRECT
    preadv (no page-cache pollution, ~5.5 GB/s with 8+ reads in flight on this box), into a
    pinned staging buffer, then copied into its slot. Two runs per expert, not six: see
    `ShardFile.expert_runs`. Each run is split into `read_chunk_mb` aligned pieces issued in
    parallel on a second thread pool, because a decode layer misses only ~4 experts and two
    serial 18.8 MB reads cannot keep the device busy on their own (see NOTES "Speed work").

Prefill chunks touch almost every expert of a layer; letting them stream through the LRU would
evict the hot set each prompt. So misses during prefill go through a small TRANSIENT ring of
slots instead, and only decode misses enter the LRU.
