# Working with `./tune.sh`

Seven things people actually do with the tool. The screen itself is described in
[`docs/tune.md`](tune.md), every field and flag in [`docs/tune-reference.md`](tune-reference.md),
the ideas in [`docs/keep-sets.md`](keep-sets.md) and the arithmetic in
[`docs/memory-budget.md`](memory-budget.md).

## Choose the topics for a workload

Start from what the server will actually be sent, not from what would be nice to have. Every topic
selected spends part of a fixed budget, and the cost of the ones you do not need is paid by the
ones you do.

How steep that cost is depends on `DSV41_PRUNE_RANK`. Under the default `sum`, which is also what
the screen budgets with, breadth is expensive: at `PRUNE_KEEP=0.36` the worst-served topic falls
0.657 -> 0.410 going from four selected topics to eighteen. Under `maxmin` the same span costs it
0.06 (both measured 2026-09-12). Neither rule creates capacity — under `maxmin` about sixteen
topics still lands the worst-served one at 0.671, below the 0.7 line — but which advice below
matters most is the rule's answer, not a constant.

1. `./tune.sh`, or `./tune.sh --list` first to see what the keep-set carries.
2. Select the topics the traffic consists of with `space`. `/` filters the list, `a` selects
   everything visible, `n` clears it.
3. Press `m`. That snaps the keep fraction to the smallest one at which **every** selected topic
   reaches the coverage target, which is the cheapest configuration that serves the selection.
4. Read the line above the keys. It names the weakest selected topic and its coverage, which is the
   number that predicts whether long generations hold together.
5. Read the verdict in the budget panel, and if it is not `FITS`, see
   [fixing an over-budget selection](#fix-an-over-budget-selection).
6. `r` writes `.env` and starts the server. `w` writes and stops.

Selecting nothing is a legitimate answer: the engine then ranks on every topic in the file, which is
what the shipped profiles do. It is the right choice when the traffic is mixed or unpredictable.

Selecting one topic is the cheapest and the most brittle. On the shipped keep-set under the `sum`
rule, `coding` alone reaches 0.85 coverage at 32 % keep where both topics together need 51 % — but
at that setting `general` covers 0.45, and a keep-set that never saw a domain does not merely get
worse at it, it produces degenerate output in it. Check the other bars before committing to a
narrow selection.

Check the bars of the registers a single request mixes, too, and not only the one it is nominally
about. On 2026-09-12 a served selection of {english, html, python, reasoning} at `PRUNE_KEEP=0.36`
left css at 0.518 and javascript at 0.564 — never selected, traced all along — and the model wrote
`* { }`, then `box-sizing: inline-block`, then the same `<style>` block over and over to the token
cap. Selecting css, javascript and typescript under `maxmin`, at the same 80.4 GB arena, produced
114 correct declarations with custom properties and no repetition.

Without a terminal, the same decisions are available one at a time:

```bash
./tune.sh --topics coding --keep 0.32 --print   # exits non-zero if it will not load
./tune.sh --topics coding --keep 0.32 --write   # same, written into .env
```

## Keep a selection as a profile

A selection that turned out well is worth more than the twenty minutes it took to find, and the
profile screen is where the next person looks first. `s` on the topic screen puts it there: it asks
for a name on the key line, `Enter` saves it, `Esc` cancels. Without a terminal:

```bash
./tune.sh --topics arabic,english,translation --save-profile "Arabic desk" \
    --describe "Arabic and English prose, for a bilingual assistant"
```

Both write `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/deepseek-v41-flash-spark/profiles.json`, which is outside the
checkout, so a saved profile survives a fresh clone and never shows up in `git status`. For a
profile that should travel with the checkout instead, put the same object in
`results/keepsets/profiles.json`; both files are read, the user's one last, and a profile there
replaces a built-in one of the same name rather than appearing twice. The format, the precedence
and what happens to a file with a mistake in it are in
[`docs/tune-reference.md`](tune-reference.md#profiles-from-a-file).

Two things to know before relying on one:

* **Topic names are a keep-set's own.** A profile that names `html` applies to a keep-set that
  carries `html`. Against one that does not, it applies with the rest of its topics, and the
  profile screen prints `not in this keep-set: html` underneath so that a selection which is
  quietly a topic short does not look like one that worked.
* **A saved profile is untested and says so.** Where a shipped profile shows the counts its own
  generation run produced — `7 of 10 strict · 9 finished`, with the date and the keep fraction under
  it — a profile from a file shows `untested`, and is budgeted from the coverage target because
  there is no measured keep fraction for it. Coverage is a measurement; whether a selection
  generates sound long output is not. Step 7 of [adding a topic](#add-a-topic-of-your-own) is how
  that gate is run, and the result belongs in `results/keepsets/<name>/GATE.md` beside the shipped
  ones.

## Read the verdict

| badge | what it means | what to do |
|---|---|---|
| `FITS` | both gates clear with at least 3 GB in hand | run it |
| `TIGHT` | it will load and serve, with under 3 GB of margin on one of the gates | fine on a box with nothing else on it; one more process and it becomes the other verdict |
| `WILL NOT LOAD` | either the engine's pre-flight refuses it, or the first prefill chunk would not fit | lower something before pressing `r`; the tool refuses to run it |

`WILL NOT LOAD` is mostly the second case, and that is the one worth understanding: the engine's own
pre-flight runs before the drafter experts, the KV cache and any prefill exist, so a configuration
can pass it, load for three minutes, log `ready`, and be killed by the memory watchdog on the first
request. On 2026-09-12 a 98 GB arena did exactly that with 5.5 GB free; an 87 GB arena left 16.5 GB
and served. The tool applies the stricter test, so it refuses configurations the engine would have
accepted.

One colouring detail: `free after load` turns red only below the keep-free floor, so it can be green
while the badge says `WILL NOT LOAD`. The badge is the number to act on.

## Fix an over-budget selection

In order of how much they buy, on a 121 GiB box with `cb3` experts:

1. **Press `m`.** If the keep fraction was set by hand it is probably higher than the selection
   needs. If `m` answers that the target needs a fraction this box cannot hold, the selection is too
   broad for this box, not the keep fraction too high.
2. **Lower the keep fraction** with `←`, and read the weakest-topic line as you go. This is trading
   coverage for memory directly; below about 0.7 on a topic that matters, expect degeneration.
3. **Check the format.** `f` switches between `cb3` at 14.45 MB a slot and `fp4` at 18.80 MB. The
   same arena holds about 30 % more experts in `cb3`. At keep 39 % that is an 86.8 GB arena against
   113.0 GB, which is the difference between serving and not fitting at all.
4. **Deselect a topic.** Watch what the remaining bars do as it goes: a narrower selection reaches
   the same coverage at a smaller keep fraction, and the keep fraction is the arena. Each 2-point
   step of the keep slider is about 320 expert slots, which is 4.6 GB. This is a `sum`-rule lever
   and it is listed here rather than second because of how much it buys under the other rule: at
   `PRUNE_KEEP=0.36` dropping from eighteen selected topics to four buys the worst-served topic
   0.247 under `sum` and 0.06 under `maxmin` (2026-09-12). It is also the lever that costs the most
   elsewhere — a register dropped from the selection is the one a long generation then breaks in.
5. **Shorten the context** only if the rest has been exhausted. It is the smallest term on the
   screen: the whole range from 32k to 256k is 0.73 GB, less than a sixth of one keep step.
6. **Check that nothing else holds the pool.** See below.

What not to do: raise `ARENA_GB` in `.env` by hand afterwards. The tool writes an arena sized to
hold exactly the kept experts plus the transient ring, and `tools/test_budget.py` checks that the
rounding never leaves a kept expert outside it. A larger arena does not make more experts routable —
`PRUNE_KEEP` decides that — it only takes memory the first prefill chunk then needs.

## Add a topic of your own

End to end, from source text to a keep-set the tool can compose. The trace is the expensive step, at
roughly a minute per layer; everything after it is arithmetic.

**1. Gather the text.** `corpus/fetch_topics.py` knows a 35-topic catalogue — sixteen programming
languages taken from a tree you point it at, eleven natural languages from Wikipedia, and eight
domain registers from a fixed set of English Wikipedia articles.

Two topics the catalogue has gained since, `reasoning` and `reasoning_code`, are written by hand and
are **not** in `fetch_topics.py`, so nothing below fetches them and `--print-topic-flags` does not
emit them. `reasoning_code`'s source is `corpus/sources/reasoning_code.txt` and its kind is `think`;
pass its flag alongside the generated ones (see [the `think` kind](#the-think-kind-for-deliberation)
below).

```bash
python3 corpus/fetch_topics.py --list                      # the catalogue
python3 corpus/fetch_topics.py --out topics --code-root ./sources --only rust,german
```

It writes `topics/<kind>/<topic>.txt`, skips a topic that is already there, and prints `THIN` for
any topic it could not fill — those are the ones that will draw a hollow bar later.

It asks Wikipedia for twenty article introductions per request, one request every two seconds,
single threaded, and backs off when told to. That is not politeness for its own sake: a burst of
parallel requests earns an IP-level 429 on every subsequent call, including single ones, for long
enough to stall the job.

For a topic the catalogue does not have, any text file works. One file per topic, not a directory.

**2. Build the trace corpus.** Each `--topic` becomes a sequence category, and one category becomes
one histogram in the finished `coverage.json`.

```bash
python3 corpus/make_corpus.py --tokenizer $MODEL_DIR --target 3000 \
    --out corpus/trace_mine.jsonl \
    $(python3 corpus/fetch_topics.py --out topics --print-topic-flags)
```

`--print-topic-flags` emits one `--topic NAME:KIND:PATH[:lang]` per file already in `topics/`, with
`KIND` being `code` or `prose`. It only ever emits what `fetch_topics.py` itself wrote, so a
hand-written topic — `reasoning`, `reasoning_code`, `reasoning_design`, `reasoning_lang` — is
silently absent from a corpus built from it alone; add those flags next to the substitution:

```bash
python3 corpus/make_corpus.py --tokenizer $MODEL_DIR --target 3000 \
    --out corpus/trace_mine.jsonl \
    --topic reasoning_code:think:corpus/sources/reasoning_code.txt \
    $(python3 corpus/fetch_topics.py --out topics --print-topic-flags)
```

The same flags can be written by hand:

```bash
python3 corpus/make_corpus.py --tokenizer $MODEL_DIR --target 3000 \
    --topic rust:code:topics/code/rust.txt:rust \
    --topic german:prose:topics/lang/german.txt \
    --out corpus/trace_mine.jsonl
```

`--target` is tokens per topic. Aim for a few thousand: below 2,000 the tool marks the topic thin,
and a thin topic's coverage is biased upward rather than merely noisy. The script prints what each
topic actually reached — that is the number to check, not the file size, because CJK text is far
denser per character than Latin text.

Only the first `--target` tokens are taken, in file order, so the ordering of a hand-written source
file is load-bearing: put the registers you care about first, or rotate them, and everything past
the cut is never traced.

### The `think` kind, for deliberation

`code` and `prose` both write `</think>` immediately after the assistant tag, so both close an
*empty* think block, and `prose` collapses every run of whitespace to a single space. Neither can
represent what a model writes inside a think block when the task is code — prose and code
interleaved, a fragment revised in the next sentence, an approach abandoned mid-thought — and
neither ever measures the close itself. Counted over the two shipped trace corpora: 95 sequences,
85 with `</think>` adjacent to the assistant tag, none with it after real content.

That gap is not cosmetic. The experts that fire on "the deliberation is finished, close it, begin
the answer" are never ranked, so on a pruned server they are not resident and the model cannot stop
deliberating: at temperature 0 it writes a decisive closing line and then repeats a short phrase to
the token cap with an answer of length zero. Lowering `reasoning_effort` makes it worse, not better.

`think` reads records and wraps them as `<think>{deliberation}</think>{answer}`, preserving
indentation and fences:

```
=== PROMPT
one line, a realistic request
=== THINK
the deliberation, fenced fragments and all
=== ANSWER
the answer
=== END
```

```bash
python3 corpus/make_corpus.py --tokenizer $MODEL_DIR --target 3400 \
    --topic reasoning_code:think:corpus/sources/reasoning_code.txt \
    --out corpus/trace_reasoning_code.jsonl
```

The whole record — prompt, deliberation and answer together — must fit `--max-len` (512, the
exactness bound of the pure-torch port); a record over budget is reported and skipped, so check the
count the script prints. Write the deliberation by hand. A model cannot produce a register its
resident experts do not cover, so sampling this text from the server that needs it is circular, and
the samples come back degenerate.

**3. Fetch the Engram rows the corpus needs.** The two n-gram tables are 101 GB each and are never
downloaded; only the rows this corpus touches are fetched, over multipart HTTP range requests.

```bash
python3 tools/engram_rows.py --model-dir $MODEL_DIR --corpus corpus/trace_mine.jsonl \
    --out engram_rows_mine
```

Add `--local-shard $MODEL_DIR/model-00047-of-00048.safetensors --local-shard
$MODEL_DIR/model-00048-of-00048.safetensors` when the shards are already on disk.

**4. Trace the routing.** One layer shard at a time, so at most one layer's weights are live.
`--resume` checkpoints after every layer, so this can run while the rest of the checkpoint is still
downloading.

```bash
python3 tools/expert_trace.py --model-dir $MODEL_DIR --corpus corpus/trace_mine.jsonl \
    --engram-dir engram_rows_mine --out results/trace-mine --layers 0-39 --resume
```

**5. Turn the trace into histograms.**

```bash
python3 tools/expert_stats.py --trace results/trace-mine --out results/keepsets/mine
```

That writes `coverage.json` with one `counts_<topic>` histogram per category per layer, which is
everything a keep-set needs. The raw per-layer trace arrays are not needed afterwards.

**6. Use it.**

```bash
./tune.sh --stats results/keepsets/mine/coverage.json --list
EXPERT_PROFILE=mine ./tune.sh
```

**7. Gate it.** Run free generation on your domains *and* on domains your corpus does not contain,
and write both results down next to the profile, the way the shipped `GATE.md` files do. A keep-set
that never saw a domain fails in it structurally, not gradually, and teacher-forced loss will not
show you that — the configuration that could not write an HTML file measured better on loss than the
one that replaced it.

## Write the topic work out as a task

The step before all of that is deciding which topic to add, and the screen cannot help with it. A
coverage bar is the fraction of a topic's *measured* routing that stays resident, so it sees a gap
in the **selection** and never a gap in the **catalogue**: a register that was never traced has no
histogram, therefore no bar, no number and no warning. That is not a hypothetical. A five-topic
profile here scored 0.85 or better on every topic it had and still reasoned in circles on a
two-train arithmetic question. Nothing on the screen was wrong. There was simply nothing there to be
wrong.

The catalogue now carries `reasoning` and `reasoning_code` (added 2026-09-12), and tracing the
second of them narrowed that diagnosis from "no reasoning register" to something far more specific:
**the think-exit was never traced at all**. Every wrapper in `corpus/make_corpus.py` other than
`wrap_think` writes `</think>` immediately after the assistant tag, so it closes an *empty* block —
across the two shipped trace corpora, 95 sequences, 85 with `</think>` adjacent to the tag and none
with it after real content (`corpus/make_corpus.py`, `wrap_think`'s docstring). The experts that
fire on "the deliberation is finished, close it, begin the answer" were therefore never ranked and
never resident, and at temperature 0 the server writes "I'll write the code now." and then repeats
"Let me write." to the token cap with an answer of length zero. `reasoning_code` (hand-written
deliberation that closes a block it actually filled) was traced on 2026-09-12 to close that gap,
and every shipped profile now carries it. It helped and it did not finish the job: on the gate runs
of 2026-09-13 and 2026-09-14 the think-exit went from a common failure to a rare one — Backend and
Data and research recorded none at all at keep 0.36 — while a fragment redrafted three to ten times
inside a long think block became the dominant remaining miss (`RESULTS.md` §5.2 and the 2026-09-14
addenda).

`--brief` writes that whole task out, as Markdown, from the keep-set that is loaded:

```bash
./tune.sh --brief > topic-task.md              # for the current keep-set and selection
./tune.sh --stats results/keepsets/mine/coverage.json --topics python,html --brief
```

`b` on the profile screen does the same into `tune-brief.md` in the checkout and says so on the key
line. What comes out is meant to be followed by hand or handed to somebody else, and it is
generated rather than copied, so it stays true as the keep-set changes:

* which topics this keep-set carries, and how many tokens each was traced on;
* which of `corpus/fetch_topics.py`'s own groups are absent or thinly sampled here, counted rather
  than asserted, and which registers the catalogue has no entry for at all;
* the commands, in order, with this checkout's paths and the flags each script requires;
* how much text a topic needs before its bar means anything, with the two measured correlations
  behind that number;
* what one more topic costs the topics already selected, in coverage and in keep fraction, computed
  on the file in hand rather than as a general caution;
* why the existing topics do not have to be traced again, with the snippet that concatenates the
  per-layer counts;
* and that the result is untested until it has been through the generation gate.

The last three are the ones people get wrong. A new topic is cheap to trace and expensive to keep:
it does not add slots, it takes a share of the ones there are, so every topic already in the
selection covers slightly less once it is added. The brief prints that number for the selection in
front of you, computed under `sum` — which is the expensive rule for this. Measured 2026-09-12 at
`PRUNE_KEEP=0.36`, four topics to eighteen costs the worst-served topic 0.247 under `sum` and 0.06
under `maxmin`, so a topic that is unaffordable on the screen may well be affordable on a server
started with `DSV41_PRUNE_RANK=maxmin`.

## When the screen says something is already running

```
 already running here: v41_engine.py (pid 12345) — this box holds one at a time
```

`r` refuses while that line is up, and `--print` and `--write` repeat it on stderr but still emit
settings. Stop the other process and wait for the memory to come back:

```bash
./stop.sh          # SIGTERM -> SIGKILL, then blocks until MemAvailable recovers
```

The waiting is the part that matters. A pinned, page-cache-backed arena is reclaimed lazily, so
`MemAvailable` climbs back over seconds rather than instantly, and starting the next server before
it lands is the classic way to wedge the box: two arenas of this size push the host past the point
where `sshd` can fork, and it answers ping and accepts TCP on 22 while being unreachable until
someone power-cycles it. The header's free figure is re-read every second, so the screen can simply
be watched until it recovers.

The probe reads `/proc`, so it sees only processes on this host, and it matches the *script*
argument of a Python process against `v41_engine.py`, `app.py`, `expert_trace.py` and
`engram_rows.py`. A shell watching for one of those names does not trip it, and something holding
the pool under a different name — another inference server, a container — will not be named, though
`start.sh` refuses below `MIN_FREE_GIB` and does list what is holding memory.
