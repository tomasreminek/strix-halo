"""budget.py -- what a topic selection costs on this box.

The engine refuses to start when the arena plus its working set will not fit
(engine/v41_engine.py, the pre-flight around `pack_scratch`), and finding that
out costs a three-minute load. This module answers the same question in a
millisecond, from the same arithmetic, so a configuration can be chosen before
it is paid for.

Two things are computed here.

MEMORY is exact. Every term below is either a shape out of the checkpoint's own
config or a constant the engine itself uses, and the total is compared against
`MemAvailable` the way the engine compares it.

COVERAGE is the interesting one. A keep-set is a cache policy learned from a
workload sample: per layer, only the top-N experts stay routable. Coverage is
the fraction of a topic's measured routing that lands on an expert that stayed.
It is the number that predicts whether generation holds together -- a topic the
trace never saw routes off the keep-set and the output degenerates, which is
exactly what a 0.03 coverage on markup did before the corpus was widened.

So the useful reading is not "how many topics" but "what is the weakest
selected topic's coverage, and what keep fraction does it need". Fewer topics
do not make a step faster on their own: step time is set by the bytes of the
experts a token activates, and that does not change. Fewer topics reach a given
coverage at a LOWER keep fraction, and a lower keep fraction is a smaller
arena -- which is where the memory, and the context window, come from.

Which experts a selection keeps also depends on HOW the selected topics are
combined into one ranking -- the engine's DSV41_PRUNE_RANK. All three rules it
accepts are reimplemented here, because a screen that ranks by `sum` while the
engine ranks by `maxmin` reports coverage the engine will not deliver: over
{english, html, python, reasoning, css, javascript, typescript} at keep 0.36
that is english 0.522 by one rule and 0.676 by the other, on the same budget.
tools/test_budget_rank.py lifts the engine's own function out and holds the two
to the same keep-set.

No torch, no CUDA, no model load. numpy if it is there, plain Python if not.
