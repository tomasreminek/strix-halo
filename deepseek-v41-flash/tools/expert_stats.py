expert_stats.py -- turn the per-layer router traces from expert_trace.py into the numbers
that decide the expert strategy (Phase 1):

  * per-layer expert usage histogram (share of routed slots per expert)
  * per-layer expert SALIENCY histogram: how much magnitude each expert contributed, not how
    often it was picked (`saliency_<topic>` next to `counts_<topic>`; see `saliency_hist`)
  * per-layer and global cumulative coverage curves: fraction of routed slots covered by
    the top-N% (or top-K) experts; global = best allocation across layers, i.e. experts
    ranked by frequency over all layers
  * block-level unique experts: DSpark verifies blocks of up to 6 tokens (1 + 5 drafts)
    at once, so what matters for a streaming cache is the union of experts touched by
    consecutive tokens, per layer
  * cache simulation: LRU over (layer, expert) with a given number of resident experts
    (FP4, 18.8 MB each), hit rate per token and per 6-token block, split by category
  * memory projection for strategies A (hot cache + stream) and C (hot FP4 + cold low-bit)

    histogram: for expert e, the total of `gate_weight(t, e) * ||expert_e(x_t)||` over the tokens
    routed to it -- the magnitude it actually contributed to the residual stream.

    SUM, where REAP's definition is a MEAN over the tokens routed to the expert. The engine
    normalises every histogram by its own per-layer total and then takes the top N, so a mean and
    a sum differ by exactly the count factor: the mean asks "how much does this expert contribute
    WHEN it fires", the sum asks "how much of this layer's output does it account for". The second
    is the question a keep-set asks, and it is the one that composes with `counts` -- sum is
    frequency x magnitude, so the two histograms are the same measurement with and without the
    magnitude factor, and `DSV41_PRUNE_SOURCE` switches between them without changing the rules
    that rank them. An expert fired once at enormous magnitude is a mean-ranking's top expert and
    is worth almost nothing to a cache policy.

    Why this matters: REAP benchmarked Kimi-K2 -- 384 routed experts, one shared, auxiliary-
    loss-free routing, the same shape as this model -- and found frequency-based pruning collapses
    (LiveCodeBench 0.434 -> 0.082 at 75 % kept, 0.000 at 50 %) where saliency holds (0.440/0.429).
