"""The generated task brief: that it comes from the loaded keep-set, and that
the commands in it are right.

Run: python3 tools/test_tune_brief.py

A brief whose commands do not run is worse than no brief, so every command it
emits is taken apart and checked against the argument parser of the script it
names: the script exists, every flag it passes is one that script defines, and
every flag that script requires is there. The Python snippet is run for real
against two keep-sets in the checkout, because "per-layer counts can be
concatenated" is the claim the whole no-re-trace section rests on.
