"""tune.py -- choose what this box should be good at, see what it costs, run it.

A keep-set is a cache policy: per layer only the top-N routed experts stay in
memory, and which N they are is decided by a measured routing trace. Picking
that set is the one configuration choice on this machine that changes both what
the model is good at and whether it fits, and until now it was made by editing
two numbers in a file and waiting three minutes to find out.

This is that choice, made visible. Select topics; the coverage bars say how much
of each topic's measured routing survives the current budget, the panel on the
right says what the budget costs against the memory this box has right now, and
the footer says which topic is worst served and what it would take to fix.

# --- the easy view ----------------------------------------------------------
# Named bundles of topics, for people who know what they want the box to do and
# not which experts that implies. A profile fixes only WHICH topics; the keep
# fraction it needs is computed from whatever coverage file is loaded, so these
# stay correct as the trace behind them improves.
#
# Every one of them carries a natural-language topic, and that is not padding.
# Selecting markup and stylesheets alone drops English coverage to 0.31, deep
# into the range where long output falls apart, and the prose inside an HTML
# page is English. Adding it back costs the markup topics about five points of
# coverage and buys English forty-five.
#
# The fourth field is the directory under results/keepsets/ that holds this
# profile's generation-gate record, and every shipped profile has one now
# (2026-09-13/14). It is not a flag: the counts, the date and the keep fraction
# are read back out of that GATE.md at startup, so a fresh gate run changes what
# the screen says by being run. The gate is there because coverage cannot see a
# gap in the topic CATALOGUE -- only a gap in the selection. The Chat profile
# scored 0.85 or better on all five of its topics and still reasoned in circles
# on a two-train arithmetic question, because no topic in the catalogue carries
# the register thinking mode writes in. Coverage warned about nothing, because
# there was nothing to warn about. Only a generation gate finds that.
#
# The fifth is the ranking rule the profile is budgeted and served with, and
# every one of them says `maxmin` (DSV41_PRUNE_RANK). A profile is a bundle of
# topics that ONE request spans at once -- a coding request with thinking on
# writes prose, deliberation, HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a single generation --
# and such a request degenerates at whichever topic in the bundle the keep-set
# serves least. `sum` optimises the total routing mass kept, which is free to
# let an already well-served topic go on taking slots while another starves; on
# the box, over {english, html, python, reasoning, css, javascript, typescript}
# at keep 0.36, that is english at 0.522 against css at 0.820. `maxmin` spends
# the same budget on the worst-served topic instead and lands every one of the
# seven between 0.676 and 0.699, which is the quantity a bundle is chosen for.
PROFILES = [
    # Every profile carries `reasoning` and `reasoning_code`: a user runs any of these with
    # thinking on, and the experts that write deliberation -- and the ones that END it and begin
    # the answer -- live in those two topics and nowhere else. A profile without them can score
    # well on every topic it names and still never close a think block (docs/tune-tasks.md).

# --- Weight Atlas -----------------------------------------------------------
# The thing this screen budgets is 15,360 experts, and the one thing it cannot do is show
# them. Weight Atlas -- `tools/atlas/`, MIT, by alesha-pro, https://atlas.alesha.pro -- draws
# exactly that: one column per expert, one row per layer, coloured by how much of the output
# each expert carried, with any topic as a slice and any keep-set as an outline over it. `a`
# exports this checkout's routing trace into the three files that page reads and serves the
# vendored build.
#
# The socket binds 127.0.0.1 on a port the kernel picks, and the thread serving it is a
# daemon, so nothing is reachable from the network and nothing outlives this process. On a
# headless box the way in is an ssh tunnel, which is why the popup says the tunnel command.
